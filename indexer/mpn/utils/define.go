// BlockLocator is used to help locate a specific block.  The algorithm for
// building the block locator is to add the hashes in reverse order until
// the genesis block is reached.  In order to keep the list of locator hashes
// to a reasonable number of entries, first the most recent previous 12 block
// hashes are added, then the step is doubled each loop iteration to
// exponentially decrease the number of hashes as a function of the distance
// from the block being located.
//
// For example, assume a block chain with a side chain as depicted below:
//
//	genesis -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 15 -> 16  -> 17  -> 18
//	                              \-> 16a -> 17a
//
// The block locator for block 17a would be the hashes of blocks:
// [17a 16a 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 4 genesis]
